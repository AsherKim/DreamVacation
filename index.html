<h1> Bora Bora </h1>
<p> Bora Bora is an island east of the Fiji Islands. Bora Bora has hut hotels that are on 
the ocean and has a very tropical feel in them. The Bora Bora Resort has hotels made from Four Seasons
and you have a bunch of things you can do like scuba diving, swimming, or just eat and sleep.
I want to go to Bora Bora because the hotel prices are 1,448 dollars a night, which means it has to be good.
